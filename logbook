1. Consider the problem youâ€™re attempting to solve
I need a faster way to collect data from Internet. Since I have no job currently, and no job means no data.

2. Describe your method for solving it
A multi-thread crawler is needed and I want to add some feature that allows me to directly turn the data into JSON form.
Probally will use existing library like scrapy to reduce my work. 

3. Describe the process of carrying out the method
First, looks deep into scrapy and let it run well(setting time period).
Second, I plan to write a JSON template and a program to read that JSON template.
The JSON template should include value like Xpath or a filename or an object that handle logic.
Third, make sure I can automatcally add url on url list from parsing or some other ways. 

4. Record what happened, and ask how it could be improved
